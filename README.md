IOT Smart Water Bottle system
Raspberry Pi + sensor to record and track water level in water bottle
Flask web app to display water bottle level, track user's daily water consumption, and calculate daily water requirements.

Remember to always create a BRANCH (git checkout -b "branch-name") or switch branches (git checkout "branch-name") so that you are NOT on "main" before making any changes!

To push changes into the main project:
git add .
git commit -m "changed the title"
git push

Then go to the repo on github, and there should be a green button to "create a pull request":
check for merge conflicts first, then ask me to review it, and then the changes will be pushed into the main branch
